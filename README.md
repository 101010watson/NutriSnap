## ðŸ“¸ What It Does

- Detects and classifies food items in images using a pre-trained ML model (YOLOv8).
- Estimates portion sizes (bonus) using reference objects.
- Maps each food item to a nutrition dataset to calculate:
  - Calories
  - Protein (g)
  - Carbohydrates (g)
  - Fat (g)
  - Vitamins and Minerals (g)
- Logs the data in a database for daily or historical tracking.
