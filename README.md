# 🥗 AI-Powered Food Recognition & Nutrition Tracker

A full-stack AI project that allows users to upload an image of their meal and receive an instant nutritional breakdown—calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats—using computer vision, machine learning, and modern web technologies.

---

## 📸 What It Does

- Detects and classifies food items in images using a pre-trained ML model (YOLOv8).
- Estimates portion sizes (bonus) using reference objects.
- Maps each food item to a nutrition dataset to calculate:
  - Calories
  - Protein (g)
  - Carbohydrates (g)
  - Fat (g)
- Logs the data in a database for daily or historical tracking.
